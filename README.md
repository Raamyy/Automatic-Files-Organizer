# Automatic Files Organizer
Python script that organizes files inside a directory into folders according to the files extensions. The file extesnions and categories are scrapped from [FileInfo](https://fileinfo.com/filetypes/common) servers.

The idea was orignally [Rohasen](https://github.com/Roshaen) at [Awesome-Automations](https://github.com/Arsenic-ATG/Awesome-Automations/tree/master/Automations/messy-folder-cleaner) so shout out to them :).
